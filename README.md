# Domain_transfer_network
This repository was made in connection with my Master's thesis regarding domain transferring, with the paper found here "link". It includes the code for a network (give name) that has learned to transfer a person from a random 'in-the-wild' environment to another, namely to a professional studio environment.


## How to use project 

The training data used for this project can be found in the "link" (folders: in-studio/img/high-resolution, customer/img/high_resolution). Due to XXX reasons, I can't share the dataset, but after downloading both datasets, run **aasdasfa.py** to generate the dataset we used. This dataset will need to be added to the 'data/' folder (if you want to train the network). To use a pre-trained model, download the model here "link".


There exist 2 executable python files, which worked with conda env: XXXX.

**utils/create_dataset.py**: instructions to generate dataset and
**use_model.py**: example code for training, generating images, and getting quantitative metrics
