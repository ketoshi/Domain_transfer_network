# Domain_transfer_network
This repository is made in connection with my Master thesis regarding domain transfering, with paper found here "link". It includes the code for a network (give name) which has learned to transfer a person from a random 'in-the-wild' enviroment, to another, namely to a proffesional studio enviroment.


## How to use project 

Training data used for this project can be found from "link" (in-studio/img/hish-resolution, customer/img/high_resolution). Due to XXX reasons I can't share the dataset, but after downloading both dataset, run **aasdasfa.py** to generate dataset we used. This dataset will need to be added to 'data/' folder (if you want to train the network). To use a pretrained model, download model here "link".


There exists 2 executable python files, which worked with conda env: XXXX.

**utils/create_dataset.py**: instructions to generate dataset and

**use_model.py**: example code for training, generating images, and getting quantitative metrics
