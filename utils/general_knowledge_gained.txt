we can see that  from bg15k 1-5:
3 64 128 256 better then 3 64 yet less memory taken. (and lr clearly reflects it)
we see that having no skip connections causes the final image to come out very blurry (and loss reflects it)

we see that using function_twice did not yield so good results
we see that only using lpips not so good, but ok with psnr/ssim (combine mse with score work for all three)
"using 255 or 15k bg background images didn't change much but not sampling randomly did help alot"

might want to check how segmentation becomes after swapping 80% of bg

png are lossless not jpg.. ;_; png better in all ways!!!!
eroision 10 10x slower


just using norm is more common then batch norm in image generation!
will use albumentations for it's big library of augmentations

#boundary not improved?
#need to improve boundary?
#most important inlightin - higher priority,   since dilation=0 --> gives ok results anyway
#try using L1 loss instead of MSE + add GAN loss
#can use some structure like ARshadowan (similar to one right now)
# focus more in lighting +   Wangxin will look at generating shadow to further augmnent images
# start of no shadow + L1 ,   then try add GAN loss
# if want can look at editing albumentations library: add random shadow
